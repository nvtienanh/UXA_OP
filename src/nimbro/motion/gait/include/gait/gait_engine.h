		* @brief Update the halt pose desired by the gait engine.
		*
		* This function should update the halt pose of the gait engine if/as required. The halt pose is
		* stored in three variables, namely #haltJointCmd, #haltJointEffort and #haltUseRawJointCmds.
		* This should be the robot pose from which the gait engine is nominally intended to be started
		* and stopped from. The halt pose should normally be relatively constant during execution, but
		* may for example depend on configuration parameters, and so is allowed to dynamically change.
		*
		* This function is intended for use by the gait engine itself as well, such as for example at
		* the beginning of the derived `step()` function override. Make no assumptions about when this
		* function is called externally.

		* @brief Main step function of the gait engine.
		*
		* The step function is called in every execution cycle that the gait is required to be active.
		* The command inputs for the gait engine can be retrieved from the `in` class member, which
		* ideally should only be read from, and the outputs of the gait engine should be written into
		* the `out` class member. Ideally *all* members of the `out` struct should be written to from
		* within the `step()` function, as the members may contain arbitrary values until written to.
		* The latest robot state information can be read from the `model` class member, which is a
		* const pointer to the required RobotModel object. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid before
		* the `step()` function is called for the first time.

		* yaw parameter is interpreted in the light of additional pitch and roll rotations is up to the
		* implementation. It is recommended that the parameter is treated as fused yaw. Ideally, after
		* calling this function the next retrieval of the robot odometry should reveal exactly @p posX
		* and @p posY in the position vector (see `GaitEngineOutput::odomPosition`). If you override this

		* will already be up-to-date anyway, but after calling this function the caller should be able
		* to take for granted that the odometry stored in @c out is up-to-date, and some valid value.
