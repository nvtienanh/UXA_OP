/*
This is a one dimensional linear inverted pendulum model.
The name LIMP is intended to be a pun. The state of the
limp consists of a gravitational constant C, the current
location x0 and the current velocity v0. These are public
variables, just set them as you like. This class offers
methods to:

- predict a future pendulum state given the current state
and a time t in the future relative to now using either
Euler integration simUpdate(t) or an analytic function
update(t).

- query the orbital energy(), which stays constant on an
undisturbed trajectory.

- find out at which point in time relative to the
current state the pendulum will reach a given location
tLoc(x), or a given velocity tVel(vx). Both of these
questions can have 0, 1 or 2 answers.

- find out at which location a certain velocity will be
reached x(vx) or what velocity the pendulum will have
at a given location vx(x). Both of these questions can
have 0, 1 or 2 answers.

- calculate a new pendulum origin() to reach a given
state (x,vx).
