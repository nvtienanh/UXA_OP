 * \image html rbdl_logo.png
 *
 * This is the documentation of RBDL, the Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The
 * library contains highly efficient code for both forward and inverse
 * dynamics. It includes:
 *
 * \li Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm
 * \li Composite Rigid Body Algorithm
 * \li Articulated Body Algorithm.
 *
 * Furthermore it contains functions for forward and inverse kinematics and
 * contact handling.
 *
 * The code is written by <a
 * href="mailto:martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de">Martin Felis
 * <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de></a> and heavily inspired by the
 * pseudo code of the book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms" of <a
 * href="http://royfeatherstone.org" target="_parent">Roy Featherstone</a>.
 * 
 * Development is taking place on <a
 * href="http://bitbucket.org" target="_parent">bitbucket.org</a>. The official repository
 * can be found at:
 * <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl/" target="_parent">http://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl/</a>.
 * 
 * The library comes with version 3 of the the
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/" target="_parent">Eigen</a> math library. More
 * information about it can be found here:
 * <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/" target="_parent">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/</a>

 * \section Example Example
 *
 * A simple example for creation of a model and computation of the forward
 * dynamics using the C++ API can be found \ref SimpleExample "here".
 *
 * Another example that uses the \ref luamodel_introduction Addon can be found \ref
 * LuaModelExample "here".
 * 
 * \section ModuleOverview API reference separated by functional modules
 * 
 * \li \ref model_group
 * \li \ref kinematics_group
 * \li \ref dynamics_group
 * \li \ref contacts_group
 *
 * \section Licensing Licensing
 *
 * The library is published under the very permissive zlib free software
 * license which should allow you to use the software wherever you need.
