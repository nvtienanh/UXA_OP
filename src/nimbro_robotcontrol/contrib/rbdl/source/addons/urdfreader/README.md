urdfreader - load models from (URDF Unified Robot Description Format) files
Copyright (c) 2012 Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

Requirements
============

This addon depends on ROS, the Robot Operating System (http://www.ros.org)
and uses its urdf_parser and urdf_interface to load and access the model
data in the files. You therefore need to have ROS and the package
"robot-model" installed on your system to be able to compile this addon. So
far only the ROS release "Fuerte" can be used with this code.

See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation for more details on how to
install ROS.

Warning
=======

This code is not properly tested as I do not have a proper urdf robot
model. If anyone has one and also some reference values that should come
out for the dynamics computations, please let me know.

Licensing
=========

This code is published under the zlib license, however some parts of the
CMake scripts are taken from other projects and are licensed under
different terms.
