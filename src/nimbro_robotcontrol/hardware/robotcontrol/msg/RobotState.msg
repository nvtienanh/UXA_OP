# Message type used by RobotModel to publish the current robot state.
#
# @param "time stamp" Time stamp of the message
# @param "string frame_id" The ID of the coordinate frame to which the data in the message pertains
# @param "Quaternion orientation" Estimated orientation of the robot expressed as a quaternion
# @param "Quaternion orientationPR" Estimated fused pitch/roll/hemi orientation of the robot expressed as a quaternion (fused without magnetometer)
# @param "Quaternion orientationNoEYaw" Estimated orientation of the robot with the ZYX Euler yaw component removed, expressed as a quaternion (derived from orientation)
# @param "Quaternion orientationNoFYaw" Estimated orientation of the robot with the fused yaw component removed, expressed as a quaternion (derived from orientation)
# @param "Quaternion orientationNoHeading" Estimated orientation of the robot with the heading component removed, expressed as a quaternion (one of orientationNoEYaw and orientationNoFYaw depending on the configuration, derived from orientation)
